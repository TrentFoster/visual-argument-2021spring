POSSIBLE ASSETS:
Binary numbers- more of like a background, to show that I am referring to tech.
Watching eyes- give off the sense that someone could be watching you browse at any time

May include my own image portraying someone trying to hack



*THIS LIST IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY*
