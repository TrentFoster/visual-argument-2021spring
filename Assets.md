Some elements that I plan on including for the project can be found below:



Binary numbers- more of like a background, to show that I am referring to tech.
Watching eyes- give off the sense that someone could be watching you browse at any time
password strength indicator
May include my own image portraying someone trying to hack







THIS LIST IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY
