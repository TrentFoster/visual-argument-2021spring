The goal for my project is to bring awareness to data privacy. In a ever growing digital
world, we are constantly creating new accounts for some new application. We store a lot of 
our private information online protected behind just a simple passcode or sometimes nothing
at all. Although the internet is a great place and allows for so many different affordances
and conveniences, it can totally destroy someones life just by someone breaching an account
of yours. I know a ton of people such as myself grew up in the digital age and are already accustomed
to the dangers that lurk online, so my main focus is not on the younger generation. My audience
is targeted at individuals who did not always have the internet at hand, and may not be aware
of the full dangers of account hacking and things of the like. I aim to get people thinking about
what they store online. Yes, it is okay to store valuable information that is kept behind
a reliable application or company, but you must have a passcode to protect that information.
A good one, not something predicable, and not the same passcode for each website.
